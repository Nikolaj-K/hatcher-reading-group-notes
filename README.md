\subsubsection*{Deformation retraction}
A homotopy $(I\times X)\to X$
between the identity $\mathrm{id}_X:X\to X$ and a retract $r:X\to A$.

I.e. a deforming of the identity by shrinking its image.

\subsubsection*{Homeomorphic}
\subsubsection*{Homotopy}
Continuous $H\colon (I\times X)\to Y$.\\

This can also be expressed as\\
$\bullet$ families into continuous functions $h\colon I\to (X\to Y)$ (such that $H\colon (I\times X)\to Y$ is also continuous.)\\
resp.\\
$\bullet$ neighboring paths of point $p\colon X\to (I\to Y)$ (such that $H\colon (I\times X)\to Y$ is also continuous.)

Here $I=[0,1]$ is the interval and we speak of a homotopy between the functions $h(0)$ and $h(1)$. 
Then $h(0)$ and $h(1)$ are homotopic.

\subsubsection*{Homotopy equivalence}
A pair $f\colon X\to Y$ and $g\colon Y\to X$ such that \\
$g\circ f$ is homotopic to the identity on $X$ \\
and also $f\circ g$ is homotopic to the identity on $Y$.

I.e. both composition maps are allowed to be continuous deformations of the identity. 

In contrast, one gets homeomorphisms (continuous bijections) when one requires the compositions to be exactly identities.
